[Week 3 - (ASCII, 1D Loops, 2D Loops, Structs, Enums)](https://youtu.be/4lleKPFgx3k)

## Tips & Tricks

### 1. Don't Fall Behind
<ul> 
    <li>This course has a lot of content and many struggle.
    <li>It's not hard, it just requires time and effort. Much of the difficulty is managing your time well.
    <li>Weeks 1 and 2 are much easier than the rest. Don't get comfortable.
    <li>Every week builds on previous weeks. If you don't understand content from week 3, you won't be able to do week 5.
</ul>
        
### 2. Read Assignment Specs Straight Away
<ul> 
    <li>The longer you give yourself to understand what you need to do, the better.
    <li>If there are parts you don't know, attend a help session to clarify straight away.
    <li>In person help sessions are much less busy than online. Go well before the due date as session will be packed otherwise.
</ul>

### 3. Sleep = Solutions
<ul> 
    <li>Sometimes when you're stuck on a problem, all you need is to sleep on it. 
    <li>The amount of times I've woken up thinking "I've got it!", well it's a bit embarassing.
</ul>

### 4. How To Approach Coding Questions
<ol>
    <li>Read the ENTIRE spec!!! Don't start without understanding the entire problem. Something at the end might.</li>
    <li>Make a plan.</li>
    <li>Use good style.</li>
    <li>A pen and pencil is your friend. Write down coordinates, draw pictures, figure out equations. Don't do it in your head :)</li>

</ol>

### 5. Use Good Style
<ul> 
    <li>Good style makes it easier to find errors. For example, stray open brackets. 
    <li>It also makes it easier for your tutors to understand your code, and therefore help you.
    <li>The honest truth is that when tutors see "poor style" it makes our jobs so much harder, which means we're less likly to do a good job helping you.
</ul>


## Starter Code Template
```

// Written by Robbie Parton z51234578 on x-x-2022

/* My Plan:
    1. initialise i to 0
    2. read in a number to be entered by the user
    3. if input < 0, print error
    4. loop while i < input

*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    return 0;
}
```
