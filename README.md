[Week 3 - (ASCII, 1D Loops, 2D Loops, Structs, Enums)](https://youtu.be/4lleKPFgx3k)

## Tips & Tricks

### 1. Don't Fall Behind
<ul> 
    <li>This course has a lot of content and many struggle. The content isn't hard, there's just a lot.
    <li>Manage your time well. Please don't try to do assignments last minute :')
    <li>Weeks 1 and 2 are much easier than the rest. Don't get comfortable.
    <li>Every week builds on previous weeks. If you don't understand content from week 3, you won't be able to do week 5.
</ul>
        
### 2. Read Assignment Specs Straight Away
<ul> 
    <li>The longer you give yourself to understand what you need to do, the better.
    <li>If there are parts you don't know, attend a help session to clarify straight away.
    <li>In person help sessions are much less busy than online. Go well before the due date as session will be packed otherwise.
</ul>

### 3. Sleep = Solutions
<ul> 
    <li>Sometimes when you're stuck on a problem, all you need is to sleep on it. 
    <li>The amount of times I've woken up thinking "I've got it!", well it's a bit embarassing.
    <li>Stay up to date and allow yourself time to sleep on it.
</ul>

### 4. How To Start a Coding Question
<ol>
    <li>Read the ENTIRE spec!!! Don't start without understanding the entire problem.</li>
    <li>Look at exactly what the sample output does
    <li>Make a plan. Write a step by step plan of what you'll do. Example: </li>
    <ol>
        <li>Print "hello welcome to my sum program"
        <li>Scan in 10 numbers
        <li>Print "the sum was XX"
        <li>For this I need to initialise i and sum to 0
        <li>Use a while loop to loop 10 times
        <li>Each loop, scan in a number and add it to sum"
    </ol>
    <li>A pen and pencil is your friend. Write down coordinates, draw pictures, figure out equations. Don't do it in your head :)</li>

</ol>

### 5. Use Good Style
<ul> 
    <li>Good style makes it easier to find errors. For example, stray open brackets. 
    <li>It also makes it easier for your tutors to understand your code, and therefore help you.
    <li>The honest truth is that poor style makes our jobs as tutors much harder. We may smile but on the inside we're crying. Make our lives easeier and we'll be able to do a better job helping you!
</ul>


## Starter Code Template
```

// Written by Robbie Parton z51234578 on x-x-2022

/* My Plan:
    1. initialise i to 0
    2. read in a number to be entered by the user
    3. if input < 0, print error
    4. loop while i < input

*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    return 0;
}
```
