## Tips & Tricks

### 1. Time Management: Don't Fall Behind
<ul> 
    <li>This course has a lot of content and the hardest part IMO is time management.
    <li>Manage your time well. Please don't try to do assignments last minute, it's impossible.
    <li>Every week builds on previous weeks. If you don't understand week 3 stuff, you won't get week 5.
    <li>Weeks 1 and 2 are much easier than the rest. Don't get comfortable :').
</ul>

### 2. Get Ready to Work Really, Really Hard...
<ul> 
    <li>Tbh, I'm a pretty normal dude and by no means a genius.
    <li>I aim for good grades honestly, most weeks I'm be studying 6 days, sometimes 7, a week and have the odd late night cram pre-tests.
    <li>CompSci is a really hard course. Getting HDs in this is much, much harder than other courses. If you're coming straight out of school, you might need 
</ul>

### 3. Make Sure To Rest and Have Support
<ul> 
    <li>If I study 7 days in a row, I'm basically guaranteed to burn out for a few days.
    <li>Make sure to take a day off every week. It's a marathon, not a sprint!
    <li>If you have a job or other commitements, you honestly may need to cut back. You have been warned.
    <li>You can't do it alone! Make sure you have people around to help you through. Shout out to my gf haha :')
</ul>

### 4. Start Everything Early, Especially Assignments
<ul> 
    <li>The longer you give yourself to understand what you need to do, the better.
    <li>If there are parts you don't know, attend a help session to clarify straight away.
    <li>In person help sessions are much less busy than online. Go well before the due date as session will be packed otherwise.
</ul>
        
### 5. Sleep = Solutions
<ul> 
    <li>Sometimes when you're stuck on a problem, all you need is to sleep on it. 
    <li>The amount of times I've woken up thinking "I've got it!", well it's a bit embarassing.
    <li>Stay up to date and allow yourself time to sleep on it.
</ul>

### 6. How To Start a Coding Question
<ol>
    <li>Read the ENTIRE spec!!! Don't start without understanding the entire problem.</li>
    <li>Look at exactly what the sample output does
    <li>Make a plan. Write a step by step plan of what you'll do. Example: </li>
    <ol>
        <li>Print "hello welcome to my sum program"
        <li>Scan in 10 numbers
        <li>Print "the sum was XX"
        <li>For this I need to initialise i and sum to 0
        <li>Use a while loop to loop 10 times
        <li>Each loop, scan in a number and add it to sum"
    </ol>
    <li>A pen and pencil is your friend. Write down coordinates, draw pictures, figure out equations. Don't do it in your head :)</li>

</ol>

### 7. Use Good Style
<ul> 
    <li>Good style makes it easier to find errors. For example, stray open brackets. 
    <li>It also makes it easier for your tutors to understand your code, and therefore help you.
    <li>The honest truth is that poor style makes our jobs as tutors much harder. We may smile but on the inside we're crying. Make our lives easeier and we'll be able to do a better job helping you!
</ul>

## Starter Code Template
```

// Written by Robbie Parton z51234578 on x-x-2022

/* My Plan:
    1. initialise i to 0
    2. read in a number to be entered by the user
    3. if input < 0, print error
    4. loop while i < input

*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    return 0;
}
```
