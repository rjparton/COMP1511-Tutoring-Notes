A conveyor belt contains n packages that need to be delivered to AlgoTown within K days. Package i has an associated weight wi â‰¤ M. Each day, the packages are loaded onto a truck in the order of their position on the belt. We may not load more than the capacity of the truck. Truck Capacity is M.



How do you determine if it is possible to deliver the packages within K days?

Capacity of truck is 5
packages: 4,3,2
k = 3

It's possible, why? can deliver one package every day
- takes 3 days


But, we can do it in two days, if we deliver:
    - day 1: 4 package
    - day 2: 3 and 2 package
